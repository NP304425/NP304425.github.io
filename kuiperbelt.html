            <p>The Kuiper Belt is a second belt full of asteroids (the first being the Asteroid Belt right between Mars and Jupiter). It is twenty times as wide as the asteroid belt, stretching from 30 - 50 AU away from the Sun. An AU is one astronomical unit, the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. Most of the dwarf planets can be seen here, and some of the more famous ones are pictured here. Despite them being so small compared to the Earth and evn the Moon, there are so many of them in the Kuiper Belt that it is many times more massive than the asteroid belt as well. Objects that share the 2:3 orbital resonance with Pluto are known as plutinos, and I think that's cute!</p>

            <p>There is an even more mysterious region of the solar system at the edge of the belt and beyond. These objects are called sednoids, because they have similar orbits to Sedna, a small asteroid with a very eccentric (ovalish) orbit that is extremely far from the Sun. The pattern of these sednoids' orbits suggest they may have been perturbed... by a ninth planet. Further still is the theoretical icy Oort Cloud, past the influence of the Sun, spanning from 2000 to 200000 AU. Most of the comets that we only see once in a thousand years, or never see again, could be from way out here.</p>
