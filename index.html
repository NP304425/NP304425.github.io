            <p>Discovered on February 18, 1930 by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It was actually seen in our neighbor state at the Lowell Observatory! Until August 2006, it was considered the ninth planet of the solar system. However, by the conditions proposed by the International Astronomical Union for an object to be classified as a planet, Pluto could not be a planet. It hadn't cleared its orbit of other objects, such as debris and asteroids from the Kuiper Belt. However, the decision to “demote” Pluto has been highly contested, and it remains everyone’s favorite dwarf planet! It even has a heart ❤️</p>

            <p>Pluto's surface is rocky and covered with ice, mostly frozen nitrogen, but there are also traces of carbon dioxide, methane, and the tiniest bit of water. Despite actually being smaller than our Moon, Pluto itself has five moons, Charon, Hydra, Kerberos, Nix, and Styx. Charon is big enough compared to Pluto that the two orbit a center of mass that is in space, so they circle around the same point rather than Charon just circling Pluto. Something interesting about Pluto's orbit is that it is so elliptical compared to the other planets, its orbit crosses Neptune's at mulitple points. They won't crash, though, since the two are in a 2:3 orbital resonance where for every two orbits Neptune makes, Pluto makes three. (This makes sense because Neptune makes a full orbit around the sun in 165 years, while Pluto takes 248). It is in a quite interesting situation.</p>
