        <p>NP304425's favorite "planet" used to be Pluto, until she found out Pluto had been demoted even before she was born! When she was in second or third grade, the outer reaches of the solar system were the most mysterious things she could fathom about the universe, and they still hold a very special place in her heart.</p>
        <p>Now, my favorite celestial objects are still very mysterious. I'm obsessed with black holes and the concept of dark matter, of there being so much more out there that we can barely even explore. I want to look into deep space forever, and maybe the inner workings of everything that exists will become a bit more apparent. It's so crazy to me how we can barely confirm anything because discoveries keep happening that contradict each other. Nature is almost unbelievable, but it's <em>real.</em></p>
        <p>I drew this Pluto! If you want to see more space drawings and little blogs, check out <a href="https://starparty134340.wixsite.com/starparty/">StarParty</a>!</p>
